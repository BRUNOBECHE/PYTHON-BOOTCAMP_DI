		<h2>	I am 50 years old and I work as Finance Team Leader at Rogers Capital Corporate Services Ltd.</h2><br>
			<p><h2> Rogers Capital Corporate Services Ltd, is a Management Company licenced by the FSC, to provide professional services to offshore companies, to establish their structures in Mauritius, Seychelles, Singapore, and also in other jurisdiction.<br></h2><p>

		<p>My jobs consist of a variety of finance support, control & compliance functions, to the management, as well as to the big team of the corporate administration and accounting services.<p>

			<br>I hold an Advanced Diploma in Business and Accounting from the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.<br>

			<h2>My Previous experiences as accountant:</h2><br>

			<p>I started my career at Chartist Consultants, a professional firm delivering Consultancy audit, company secretarial, tax advisory and accounting services, after which I joined a group of companies named T-Printers/Carton & Boxes, that were involved in the printing/publishing as well as manufacturing.<br>
			</p>
			<p>Thereafter, and up to now, I joined the professional firm named Kross Border Trust Services, which was an entity forming part of KPMG Mauritius, which in its course, was spin out, and then acquired and merged with various entities, such as Globefin & Rivercourt administrators, to finally become Rogers capital under the structures of Rogers & ENL Group.<br>
</p>
<p> <h1>Next Goal</h1></p>
		It is a challenge for me to enroll onto the environment of coding, which is totally unknown to me.<br>

		I am amazed over the possibilities and creativity that this course would help me to achieve.<br>

		I look forward to achieve and develop great things upon completing and mastering the coding concepts.<br>
